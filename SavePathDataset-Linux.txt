# A comment must start with "#"
# These are all for linux the save location, windows might be different (it's very annoying)
# This is an example of a comment
# alternate target paths are not supported right now
# empty line in the file are not recommended right now
# TODO remove status and store in a different way.
# status. I will put Clear at the end of a line if I do not have the game so cannot test (or have just not tested yet)
# status. I will put Gold at the end of a line if it works on my computer
# status. I will put Wrong at the end of the line if I think that the save location is wrong (This is not a sure thing)
#A space is not needed after a comment but is recommended
